<b>Project Description: In this project, we used Unsplash, which is a website that has a collection of pictues. Team 5 worked collectively to extract information about pet photos from the LIte vesion of the Unspash Dataset and used it to construct a website. We used a tool called a Static Site Generator to create the HTML for this site. Together we addressed shortcoming such as unused metadata from the Unslash Dataset, missing basic sections of the document, and the badly-forned and invalid HTML. Our team members listed above worked on different tasks: Christopher Millones worked on adding additional features to bring more life to our website, Quentin May worked creating individual pages for each photo, Stanley Shi worked on enhancing the site-wide layout, and Joe Rico Added an about us page </b>
